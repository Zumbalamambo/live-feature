# End-to-end Example

## Train, eval, and export model.

```
python train.py
```

This will create a SavedModel in `/tmp/exportdir`.
You can inspect its signature with:

```bash
```

## Upload to Cloud ML Engine

First:

* Create a Cloud Platform project
* Create a bucket in Google Cloud Storage
* Create a new model in Cloud ML Engine

You'll have to modify some parameters in `upload_model.sh`, then run it.


## Test

Run `python examples.py` to generate an examples.json file with a few json format
examples generated by the LiveFeature expander.

Send these to your model via:

```
python cloudml_client.py --examples=examples.json
```

You should get back a predicted (albeit senseless) value for `baz_hat`.
